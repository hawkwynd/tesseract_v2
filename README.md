# Tesseract 
## A Shoutcast Stream Content Application
This is the project of Hawkwynd Radio's web front end, which is a labor of love in the search for a better display of metadata/content while a song is being played on the Shoutcast Server. My love of music, and running my own station started with a idea, and has grown to this point. It is open source, and constantly being improved/updated. Soley for personal use, I make no warranties or provide any assurance this will work on your system. 

This application displays the current Artist and title being played on your Shoutcast server, as well as the following objects:

- Image of the album the song is from, with modal window to display large view when image is clicked on
- Artist Members sorted by Active and Inactive (Alumni)
- Release track listing of songs from the release the song is from
- About Artist Wikipedia content
- About Release Wikipedia content
- Artist Discography in chronological order
- Song History of the last hours played songs (Artist/Title)
- On each new song, refresh all areas, change background color, change background image, update Now Playing banner, uptime ticker and listener counter

### Requirements to make this work
- Apache Webserver with Mysql and PHP 
- Shoutcast Server (sc_serv) with admin access
- Love of being a radio station kind of person, who loves music.

#### NOTE: I share this repository to anyone who is looking to have a better, responsive HTML based Shoutcast Radio station front-end.

### How it works (PSEUDO CODE)
- Tesseract asks Shoutcast Server for current playing Artist/Title `Pink Floyd` - `Money`
- Ajax call to Discogs API with Artist/Title which returns: release, label, image and artist objects.
- PHP will check for a local copy of the cover image based on the release_id, if not found, it downloads it from discogs, and stores in the /img/covers directory. (make /img dir writable for Apache )
- Wikipedia api query to obtain About Artist content, About Release Content (if found)
- Sort Release Discography of Artist
- Prepare all content, and update MYSQL tables with Artists, ExtraArtists, Members, Release, Recording and Wikipedia profile objects.
- Render Page with nice fades, background image changes, and colors.

## Installation / Configurations
Requires MYSQL database. Set your Shoutcast configuration details and MYSQL credentials.

`mysql/stream_mysql.sql` 
 
 Import the `stream_mysql.sql` file into your database.

Set your Discogs Developer Api Key/Secret

`js/tessa2.js`
```
var auth = { 
    key: 'discogsKey',
    secret: 'mydiscogsecret',
    page: 1,
    per_page: 10,    
};
```

`include/config.inc.php` 

 Make your configuration changes in this file or shit wont do diddly squat.  

```
define('SHOUTCAST_HOST', 'http://myradiowebsite.com:8000'); // url:port to your shoutcast server
define('SHOUTCAST_ADMIN_PASS', 'mypassword'); // admin password for accessing admin.cgi
define('SCROBBLER_API', 'scrobbler_api_key'); // API key from lastfm to query data (no longer used)
define('APPLICATION_NAME', 'My Radio station'); // Name of your website's application
define('NOW_PLAYING_TXT', 'Now Playing'); // Content to display as Now Playing
define('SITE_URL', 'http://mywebsite.com'); // used in FB share link (deprecated)

define('MYSQL_USER', 'myusern'); // your mysql username
define('MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD', 'mysql_password'); // your mysql user password
define('MYSQL_DATABASE', 'mydatabaseName'); // your mysql database
define('MYSQL_HOST', 'localhost'); // your mysql hostname
```

## TODO and future plans
- Teseract to first check for local MYSQL results before making Discogs API calls and use that result instead. 

Feel free to create an issue if you're experiencing one, and I'll make an honest effort to help you.

Peace, Love & Joy!
